#### QuizApp Android Basic

This is a quiz app built to test knowledge of users on basic random questions. Users are to select either True od False and after answering the four questions, are to click on the submit button which in-turn notifies the user that the result have been received.

Subsequent versions would allow users see how many answers they got correctly and the correct answers for the ones missed.
